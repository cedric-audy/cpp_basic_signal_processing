# cpp basic signal processing - smarties counter

The present code is the product of a school project. The goal was to count the number of smarties of each color present in the image.

The current master version is the most advanced, with adequate lighting equalization, edge and circle detection, but also has very redundant code.

The version on dev is a failed attempt at making the code prettier, by using multiple levels of abstraction and inheritance of process strategies. The result is 7-15x slower than the redundant code on master.
